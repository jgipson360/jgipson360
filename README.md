# 👋 Hi, I'm @jgipson360!

**TL;DR:** Enterprise Architecture leader with 15+ years turning complex technical transformations into business wins. Still get excited about solving the impossible! 🚀

## 👀 What I'm All About

I'm an Enterprise Architecture leader who specializes in modernizing legacy systems and building cloud-native architectures that actually work for the business. There's something deeply satisfying about taking fragmented systems and creating cohesive platforms that empower teams to do their best work.

My approach? I bridge the gap between technical excellence and business strategy. Whether I'm developing new frameworks, mentoring emerging architects and developers, or presenting to executive leadership, I focus on practical solutions that move the needle and deliver tangible business value.

## 🌱 My Journey (2005 - Present)

Nearly two decades in tech, and I've seen it all! Started as a Network Admin when we were still figuring out what "the cloud" meant, evolved through Web Development during the jQuery revolution, cut my teeth in IT Consulting, Software Engineering, Principal Engineering, and now leading Enterprise Architecture initiatives.

Fun fact: I was architecting event-driven systems when they were still considered "experimental." Watching the industry catch up to patterns I've been championing for years has been incredibly rewarding!

## ⚡ Fun Fact

After 15+ years in enterprise architecture, I still get genuinely excited about solving "impossible" integration challenges. I believe the best architecture is invisible – it just enables great business outcomes. Also, I've probably seen every possible way a legacy system can surprise you (and lived to tell the tale)!
